## Rural road extraction from remote sensing images based on multi-view contextual information and multi-stage features

## Introduction

The following samples present challenges in the extraction of rural roads from remote sensing images.:

## Dataset

- Supported Remote Sensing Datasets
  - [DeepGlobe Roads Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/deepglobe-road-extraction-dataset) 
  - [Massachusetts Road Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/)
  - More datasets will be supported in the future.

## Overview framework of UMFormer

We aim to design a precise semantic segmentation network for remote sensing images. Inspired by the self-attention mechanism and Mamba, we propose UMFormer, a network that fuses these two techniques within an encoder-decoder framework to address the aforementioned challenges. UMFormer combines the respective advantages of CNN, self-attention mechanism and Mamba to create a hybrid network effectively.

## Comparison of network parameters

In the context of remote sensing image semantic segmentation, the parameter size, complexity and speed of the network are also crucial evaluation indicators. In response, a comparison is made between UMFormer and efficient semantic segmentation networks, including the number of model parameters (M), the floating point operation count (FLOPs) and the frames per second (FPS).
