## Rural road extraction from remote sensing images based on multi-view contextual information and multi-stage features

## Introduction

The following samples present challenges in the extraction of rural roads from remote sensing images.:

## Dataset

- Supported Remote Sensing Datasets
  - [DeepGlobe Roads Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/deepglobe-road-extraction-dataset) 
  - [Massachusetts Road Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/)
  - More datasets will be supported in the future.

## Overview framework of CRRENet

The overall structure adopts the encoder-decoder structure and improves on it, which consists of five parts: feature encoder, the MCIEM, the MFFM, the CCAM, and feature decoder.
